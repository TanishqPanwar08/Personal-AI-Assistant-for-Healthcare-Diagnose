Designing a versatile healthcare solution applicable to both individuals at the ground level and large hospitals. The system should offer accessible disease prediction and management tools for individuals while also providing comprehensive support for big hospitals, including advanced analytics and integration capabilities to enhance healthcare services and patient outcomes.

Individuals or hospitals will use the system for specific diseases. After selecting a disease, users will input relevant health details. The system will then predict whether the individual is healthy or at some stage of the disease. Users can choose to receive prescriptions and suggestions for nearby healthcare facilities. Upon approval, the system provides prescriptions and recommendations for curing the disease, along with suggestions for nearby hospitals, clinics, and doctors, utilizing various machine learning and deep learning models.

Afterwards, the system requests an overall rating and review from the user. Using natural language processing (NLP), the system predicts whether the user's experience was positive or negative based on the sentiment and rating. Continuous updates to the system are made based on user feedback.
